# My EDX Personal Portfolio

This is my first initial portfolio project, meant to highlight the knowledge I have gained though the bootcamp as far as now.

## Installation

None Applicable
```

## Usage

Clink on the available link, and open the readme, and start to look though the page.
I did struggle with this, as external factors meant I was doing a catch-up for a lot of the design, I will work on this in the future.
